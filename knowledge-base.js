  "credit line": {
    answer: `**XBO Credit Line (CL)** allows clients to trade and open positions without holding funds upfront.

**How it works:**
1. Client receives a Credit Line in selected fiat or crypto
2. Trade using the CL via platform or API
3. Sell first, deposit later - sell asset with zero balance, buy another
4. Purchased asset pending until sold amount is deposited
5. Once deposited, purchased asset becomes withdrawable

**Example:**
• Credit Line: 1,000,000 EUR
• Trade: Sell 200,000 EUR → Buy 220,000 USDC
• Remaining CL: 800,000 EUR
• USDC withdrawable after depositing 200,000 EUR`,
